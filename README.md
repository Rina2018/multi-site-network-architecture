# Multi-Site Network Architecture with Dual ISP & VPN

## Overview

Designed a resilient multi-site network architecture connecting core infrastructure with a secondary production unit using secure VPN tunnels and dual ISP redundancy.

## Objectives

- Ensure business continuity
- Provide WAN redundancy
- Secure inter-site communication
- Enable centralized monitoring

## Architecture Components

- Core Infrastructure Network
- Dual ISP WAN Connectivity
- Site-to-Site VPN Tunnel
- Secondary Production Network
- CCTV & Monitoring Integration

## Key Design Considerations

- Automatic failover between ISPs
- Segmented internal network structure
- Secure routing between sites
- Controlled inter-network traffic flow
- Centralized visibility and monitoring

## Technologies Used

- MikroTik Routing
- Dual WAN Failover Logic
- VPN Tunnel Configuration
- VLAN Segmentation
- Network Monitoring Integration

## Outcome

Improved network resilience, reduced downtime risk and ensured secure communication between geographically separated sites.
